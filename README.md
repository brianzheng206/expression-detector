# Detect Expressions

Open-source scaffolding for a facial/expression recognition project built around MediaPipe Face Mesh. This repository includes a clean workspace layout with packages, scripts, config files, and documentation placeholders. No implementations are provided—just structure to help you start fast and keep it organized.

## Highlights
- Scripts to train and run inference (placeholders)
- Scripts to create and annotate datasets (placeholders)
- Modular Python package layout under `src/`
- Config files for dataset, training, and inference
- Docs and contribution guides to look good in public
